Classification_Wine_Dataset

Dataset: 

     - These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in 
       the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. 
     
     - The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in 
        each of the three types of wines.
        
 Implementation steps:
    
    1- Load the dataset.
    
    2- Extracting the most two important features.
    
    3- Split the dataset.
    
    4- Implement GaussianNB classifier:
    
       - Gaussian Naive Bayes is a variant of Naive Bayes that follows Gaussian normal.
       
     5- use the classification report to calculate precision, recall and F1 score
     
         - A Classification report is used to measure the quality of predictions from a classification algorithm. 
         
         - How many predictions are True and how many are False.
         - More specifically, True Positives, False Positives, True negatives, 
            and False Negatives are used to predict the metrics of a classification report.
            
      6- Plot the decision boundary.
       
Implementation of KNN Classifier:

    1- Load car_evaluation dataset.
    
    2- perform label encoding.
    
    3- split the dataset to training and testing.
    
    4- Analysis the training time when use different number of training samples.
    
 
 Conclusion:
      - During this assignment we learned more about the calculation process 
        of Bayesian Rule Based Classifier to make prediction on a dataset, and 
        how to calculate the risk and rejection area of the model.
      
      - We learned more about the Na√Øve Bayes classifier, and how to use the 
         GaussinNB classification algorithm, how to extract the most important 
         features and show them in the decision boundary figure, after that we 
         learned more about the KNN classification algorithm and how to apply 
         different numbers of training set and different numbers of K, so we 
         realized that the KNN algorithm require more time when the number of 
          K increased.
